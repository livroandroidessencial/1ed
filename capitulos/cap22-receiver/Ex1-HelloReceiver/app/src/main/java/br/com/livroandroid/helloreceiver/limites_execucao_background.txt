As part of the Android 8.0 (API level 26) Background Execution Limits,
apps that target the API level 26 or higher can no longer register broadcast receivers for implicit broadcasts in their manifest.

However, several broadcasts are currently exempted from these limitations.
Apps can continue to register listeners for the following broadcasts, no matter what API level the apps target.
